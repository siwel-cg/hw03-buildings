# Breakdown
Overall I wanted a slightly different type of generator than what the tutorial was going for. Rather than having a tool the lets you completely customize each part of a single building, I wanted a system that allowed for a more scallable tool for larger scale scattering. This lead me to have my tool take in a base grid which the house would be generated on. Additionally, my sytem is more random based with parameters to limit and control that random valus. This makes getting a large variety of completely unique building much easier in the future.

## Base Structure
The base scattering of the box was done a bit differently from the intructed tutorial. Since the look I was going for was more chaotic than just base blocks stacked ontop of eachother, I had my inital blocks be placed randomly above an inputted plane. This allowed for both position and orientation of the blocks to randomized while also also allowing me to specify the number of bases I wanted. To generate the upper blocks, I scattered points ontop of the
